<h1>Developed a Java-based hotel management system with a focus on handling customer reservations. The application enables users to reserve rooms, view booking records, retrieve room numbers based on contact information, update registration details, and delete registrations. The project involved designing and implementing a MySQL database to store room reservation data, using SQL queries, prepared statements, and database connection handling. It also incorporates validation to ensure accurate user input, particularly for phone numbers and booking IDs.</h1>
